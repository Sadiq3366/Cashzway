                                <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                                    <p>“Through service excellence and convenience, we are the leaders in providing immediate access to cash and financial services”.
                                        We are a financial services company that began with the belief of putting people first. From the moment we first opened our doors, to the company we are today – we have always stood by our goal to set the highest standards for customer service, convenience and quality financial products and services. More than 30 years later, this is still the mission that guides us.</p>
                                <h4>Our History</h4>
                                    <p>Cash Z Way® began as an entrepreneurial venture in 1982 in Edmonton, Alberta. At the time, the company’s founders had recognized a growing trend towards convenience and service in the financial services industry. To fully accommodate this trend, branches were opened outside of regular business hours and situated in easily accessible locations. As time passed, we earned the trust of our customers by consistently exceeding their expectations – a commitment that continues to this day.
                                    Growth for Cash Z Way has been continuous. By 1994, we had over 100 franchised and corporate branches. By 2000, Cash Z Way exceeded the 200-outlet mark. Today, we employ more than 2,000 Canadians and have over 550 branches across Canada.
                                    In 1996, Dollar Financial Group, Inc. purchased the Canadian company from its founders. In January 2018, Dollar Financial Group, Inc. began doing business as Cash Z Way Financial Services Group to reflect the expanded services we now provide our customers. Cash Z way Financial Services Group owns and operates one of the largest providers of accessible consumer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked in North America with over 800 retail locations across the United States and Canada.</p>
                                <h4>Our Customers</h4>
                                    <p>The typical Cash Z Way customer accurately represents the average, working Canadian. Statistically, the average customer is 32 years of age and employed with an annual income at the national average – 82% of all customers are under the age of 45.
                                    The vast majority of Cash Z Way customers have a bank account, but prefer to use Cash Z Way for our service attributes.</p>
